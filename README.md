# Motor-and-Sensors-Libraries
Motor and Sensors Libraries developed by Manaus Instituto de Tecnologia, Brazil

For project development at Manaus Instituto de Tecnologia, few libraries were developed/adapted for motors and sensors.
The processor used is NXP LPC1768. It is a mbed family processor. 
I used the compiler as Adam Green shows in his GitHub account. :)

The libraries are:<br  />
GPS <br  />
GY80, that includes ADXL345, L3G4200D and HMC5883L libs <br  />
A simple ServoMotor lib <br  />
Linear actuator <br  />
Step-Servo Motor (also known Industrial Servo) <br  />
